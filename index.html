          <h1>Languages & History</h1>
          <p>
          &nbsp;Although CS and programming classes are some of the most interesting classes I've taken, I have found that they consistently lack coverage of certain topics which I would find meaningful to my understanding of programming. The most notable of these features is a historical and contextual introduction to the development of a language. If I'm studying Python, I want to know why Python was developed. What gap in programming languages existed to motivate the development of an entirely new language? Java is a compiled language, Python is an interpreted language, and C is an imperative language all for their own purposes. In class, the only differences taught are syntactical, and a few different built in functions here and there. If programming classes gave a better context for a language, such as why one over the other, what they excel at, and why they were introduced, I would gain a stronger understanding of the field. Hello World and similarly elementary programs such as our assignments can be coded in any language, which mystifies the role of language and the overarching role of computer science.

          <h1>Why Geeks Should Write</h1>
          <p>
          &nbsp;Today, everyone is a geek in some way or another. Whether they geek out over fashion, insects, or programming, communities exist online for everyone to develop their interests. Being able to geek out like this is a luxury: anyone with internet access can learn what they want when they want it, anonymously and at their own pace.
          </p>
          <p>
          &nbsp;The privilege of accessing the expanse of all human knowledge in the comfort of one’s pajamas comes with but one constraint: literacy. In order to withdraw any significance from the archives, one must be able to read and write. For most information online, the format of communication is the written word, and with good reason. Writing is timeless and objective in a way personified spoken word and music isn’t. Geeks should write because it gives them an opportunity to edit, revise and reconstruct until what they write becomes what they mean. It gives them the opportunity to participate and contribute to their larger community of geeks. Verlyn Klinkenborg, a favorite writer of mine, wrote:

          <blockquote>
        If you could look through the spaces between the sentences,<br>
        Through the door into the writing room, into that writer’s head,<br>
        You’d see that every word was different once<br>
        And that the writer was contemplating<br>
        An incalculable number of differences,<br>
        Feeling her way among the alternatives that presented themselves,<br>
        Until settling upon words that were finally written down,<br>
        Then revised over and over again --<br>
        Before they were printed, published, reprinted in anthologies,<br>
        And treated as though they’d been carved in stone.<br>
