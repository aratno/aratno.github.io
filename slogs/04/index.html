        <h1 id="slog-4-object-oriented-programming">SLOG 4: Object Oriented Programming</h1>

<p>I frequently feel confronted by the many goals of computer science classes, and my participation in them. On one hand, I’m there to learn to “code” (which is an ambiguity I’ll explain in a later SLOG). This “coding” thing includes the structures and practices which promote readability and appeal to intuition, because programs are written to be read by others. On the other hand, I’m learning computer science to understand a greater ordeal: the mathematical abstractions of the world into data, and the manipulation of that data. There is no best way to go about this abstraction, as shown by the many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm">programming paradigms</a> of varying complexity. After even a light skim of the page linked it becomes clear that converting the world into data by use of objects isn’t the only way to do it.</p>

<p>Once you learn about the object oriented paradigm, it doesn’t leave you. You see notebooks as objects with attributes <code>cover</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>pages</code>, and <code>type</code>, and methods <code>open()</code>, <code>write_page()</code>, and <code>close()</code>. You see people as objects with attributes <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>height</code>, and methods <code>say()</code>, <code>ask()</code>, and <code>talk()</code>. The paradigm organizes the things in the world into what they’re made up of (attributes) and what they do (methods).</p>

<p>But, by introducing the world in terms of Python and objects, we hold ourselves back. As an initiation to computer science, CSC148 should introduce the abundance of perspectives available, and an understanding of which perspectives are appropriate in solving certain problems.</p>
