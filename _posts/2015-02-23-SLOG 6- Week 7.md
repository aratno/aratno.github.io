### `SLOG 6: Impressions of Week 7`

This week, we spoke about a specific type of tree: the linked list. Linked lists are interesting for a couple reasons. First of all, they are a cool new take on arrays. Second, they are unary trees.

There are two perspectives one can take when considering a linked list. The list can be thought of as iterative or as recursive. In the iterative case, each element points to its partner like a group of children blaming each other for a wrongdoing. The recursive definition is that the data of each node in the list includes reference to another list.

*The iterative perspective:*
[a] => [b] => [c] => [d] => None

*The recursive perspective*
a = [b, c, d]
b = [c, d]
c = d
d = None

At this point, I have little understanding of why one would use a linked list in preference to an array. If I think about a linked list as a decision tree for a world without free will, it makes a little bit of melancholy sense.
