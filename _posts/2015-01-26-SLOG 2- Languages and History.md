### `SLOG 2: Languages & History`

Although CS and programming classes are some of the most interesting classes I've taken, I have found that they consistently lack coverage of certain topics which I would find meaningful to my understanding of programming. The most notable of these features is a historical and contextual introduction to the development of a language. If I'm studying Python, I want to know why Python was developed. What gap in programming languages existed to motivate the development of an entirely new language? Java is a compiled language, Python is an interpreted language, and C is an imperative language all for their own purposes. In class, the only differences taught are syntactical, and a few different built in functions here and there.

If programming classes gave a better context for a language, such as why one over the other, what they excel at, and why they were introduced, I would gain a stronger understanding of the field. Hello World and similarly elementary programs such as our assignments can be coded in any language, which mystifies the role of language and the overarching role of computer science.
