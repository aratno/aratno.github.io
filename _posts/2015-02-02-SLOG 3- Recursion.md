### `SLOG 3: Recursion`

It's come to the point in the semester when I lose my sense of horology. I think it's week four. The theme of this week was recursion, and I found it to be lackluster. Recursion is not immediately a computer science topic. Recursion also exists in mathematics, where a function has some condition in which the function itself may be evaluated. Most of our examples were like this in practice. Unlike I would have hoped, most of the problems attempted to confuse the reader, as opposed to demonstrate to the reader the power of recursive functions. The attitude seemed to be more of "Recursive functions are confusing versions of iterative functions" as opposed to "Recursive functions let you solve multi-step problems until a given conclusive state is reached." There was no emphasis on scope, stack overflow errors, memory access, or the other quirks of recursion.
