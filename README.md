### Next to come:
* Better favicon
* **Mobile site**
    - I've decided to do a mobile site from scratch for the same reason I decided to use skeleton. If I'm working on a personal site, I should make it as much of a learning experience as possible. 
* Some content, perhaps?
* More layouts for that content. Not everything should share a layout.
* A passive Stream, to be explained later.
